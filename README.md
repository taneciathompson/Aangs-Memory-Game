# Aangs-Memory-Game
A matching game run with node-PreviousExpress
This project reinforces my understanding on the core concepts of Node.JS and Javascript ES6 features and their applications. I wanted to keep my code as simple as possible. I wanted to do a throwpack theme for this project! The product came out clean, eye catching and fun! By the end of it. I'm excited for the future projects, so stay tuned!
